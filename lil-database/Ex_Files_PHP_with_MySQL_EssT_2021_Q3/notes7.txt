An sql insert statement:
    INSERT INTO table(col1, col2, col3)
    VALUES(val1,val2,val3);

Use form data to create records:
    -use INSERT query
    -no subjects.id required
    -usually from form data
    -returns true or false

The way to find out what ID was created:
    mysqli_insert_id($connection)
 It basically says, hey, MySQL, I just gave you an insert statement. You just created a new record. I'd like to know what ID you assigned to it. Can you tell me that?

 SQL UPDATE statement
    UPDATE table
    SET col1 = 'this', col2 = 'that'
    WHERE id = 1;

Use form data to create records
    -use UPDATE query
    -updating a single record requires subjects.id (primary key)
    -usually from form data
    -returns true or false (not a result set)

SQL DELETE statement
    DELETE FROM table
    WHERE id = 1;

DELETE a record
    -use a DELETE query
    -deleting a single record requires subjects.id
    -form post is optional; POST is best practice
