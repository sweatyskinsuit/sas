(1, 'Southern Red-Backed', 'The southern zigzag salamanders only occur in a small area in western North Carolina. These rare salamanders may be found in wooded areas near springs or cave mouths. They also inhabit rocky areas with deep, cool crevices.', 'There are two distinct color morphs of the southern red-backed salamander. The striped morph has a dark grey or brown base color with an orange or red stripe stretching from the head to the end of the tail.'),
(2, 'Southern Zig Zag', 'The southern zigzag salamanders only occur in a small area in western North Carolina. These rare salamanders may be found in wooded areas near springs or cave mouths. They also inhabit rocky areas with deep, cool crevices.', 'Coloration of the body is dark grey with a wavy or jagged “zigzag” stripe down the back. This stripe is yellow to red in color. The stripe may be very dark and difficult to see on some individuals. The sides of this salamander are dark with some white speckling. The belly is typically dark grey and may show traces of red or yellow pigment.'),
(3, 'Pigeon Mountain Salamander', 'The Pigeon Mountain Salamander is found in northwestern Georgia and parts of Alabama, typically in limestone outcroppings and caves.', 'These salamanders have dark brown to black coloration with some white flecking. They are known for their preference for rocky environments and are nocturnal.'),
(4, 'Slimy Salamander', 'Slimy salamanders are entirely terrestrial. In North Carolina, these salamanders are most abundant in moist forest floor habitats in deciduous forests but may be found in pine forests, bottomland hardwood forests, and caves.', 'The slimy salamander was formerly considered a single species but has since been divided into a complex of closely related species. Six of these species may be found in North Carolina but they are often indistinguishable in the field.'),
(5, 'Green Salamander', 'Green salamanders typically inhabit moist, shady crevices in cliffs and rock faces. In North Carolina, the green salamander is found only in a small mountainous region in the southwestern corner of the state.', 'The green salamander has an unmistakable lichen-like pattern of green or yellow-green on a dark background. This salamander is laterally flattened and has squared toe tips.');
